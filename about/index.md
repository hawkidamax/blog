I am a person that writes stuff. Considerably less stuff than I imagined I would when I thought I wanted to be a writer when I grew up.

Born in '73, I'm on a countdown to retirement, now. I spent most of my working life in web development and have transitioned to something more managerial in the past few years.

Despite appearances, I never did really grow up. I still plan to learn to skateboard. I spend a lot of time in fields playing grown-up let's pretend (larping), and I slide in and out of the science fiction fandom social circles.

These days I'm a civil servant. This means I have to follow the Civil Service Code. I'm not allowed to tell you my thoughts on the Civil Service Code, or things like the Government and politicians. So I won't. I will probably talk about work in a broader sense quite often, though.
