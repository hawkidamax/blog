## What I'm doing now

### Work
I'm the lead frontend developer for the GOV.UK website. I've wound up leaning more into the Lead side of the role than the Frontend side of it, because I can rely on a sterling crew of developers to know far more than I can keep in my mind as I head from meeting to meeting organising things behind the scenes.
